    title: Building new kinds of Natural Language Understanding and Conversational AI with Deep Learning
    abstract: "Deep learning provides new fundamental tools, such as contextualised word embeddings and seq2seq models, that let us build new kinds of Natural Language Understanding apps faster, better and cheaper than ever before.  The advanced pattern-matching capabilities of deep learning enable a new approach to app development where the system's behaviour is learnt from training data, dramatically reducing the need for manual scripting.  This talk describes how we are using this technology in the Oracle Digital Assistant, focusing especially on Conversational AI.  The talk ends with a discussion of how research advances in areas such as explainability, few-shot learning, data augmentation and transfer learning can help this technology achieve its full potential."
